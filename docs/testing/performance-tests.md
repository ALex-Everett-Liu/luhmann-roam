## Performance Test Cases

### Large Hierarchy Tests

#### PT-1001: Load Large Node Structure
- **Description**: Test loading performance with large number of nodes
- **Setup**: Create 1000 nodes with 5 levels of hierarchy
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Load the application
  2. Measure time to render all nodes
  3. Expand/collapse parent nodes and measure response time
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Initial load under 3 seconds
  - Expand/collapse operations under 300ms
- **Actual Results**: [To be filled during testing]
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Medium

#### PT-1002: Node Creation Performance
- **Description**: Test node creation performance under load
- **Setup**: Existing structure with 500 nodes
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Add 100 new nodes in sequence
  2. Measure time for each operation
  3. Calculate average and maximum times
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Average creation time under 200ms
  - Maximum creation time under 500ms
- **Actual Results**: [To be filled during testing]
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Medium
