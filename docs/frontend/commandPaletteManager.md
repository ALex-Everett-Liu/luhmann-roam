# CommandPaletteManager Documentation
## Overview
The CommandPaletteManager (commandPaletteManager.js) is a client-side module responsible for providing a searchable command interface similar to VS Code or Obsidian. It allows users to quickly access and execute commands through a unified interface triggered by Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on Mac).
## Module Design
The CommandPaletteManager uses the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) pattern that returns a public API. This approach encapsulates private state while exposing only necessary methods for interacting with the manager.
