# StyleSettingsManager Documentation

## Overview
The StyleSettingsManager (styleSettingsManager.js) is a client-side module responsible for managing the visual appearance and styling preferences in the Luhmann-Roam system. It provides functionality for users to customize colors, fonts, backgrounds, and other visual elements of the application through a user-friendly settings panel.

## Module Design
Like the NodeOperationsManager, the StyleSettingsManager uses the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) pattern that returns a public API. This approach encapsulates private state while exposing only necessary methods for interacting with the manager.

## Implementation Pattern

The system follows a similar architecture to other managers in the application:
1. app.js contains simplified wrapper functions that call the StyleSettingsManager
2. styleSettingsManager.js contains the detailed implementation for handling style settings

This separation of concerns provides:
- Modularity: Style settings functionality is isolated
- Reusability: Style management can be invoked from anywhere
- Consistency: All styling operations go through a single manager
- Maintainability: Implementation changes don't affect the rest of the application
